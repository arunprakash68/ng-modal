# ng-modal

A simple, lightweight interface for creating layered modal dialogs in Angular 5.

## Installation

1. Install npm module:
```bash
$ npm install @browninglogic/ng-modal --save
```

2. Import ModalManagerModule
```typescript
@NgModule({
  declarations: [
    AppComponent
  ],
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    ModalManagerModule
  ],
  providers: [],
  bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
})
export class AppModule {}
```

## Usage

Use the following syntax for declaring a modal-window component within your app

```html
<input type="button" (click)="myModal.show()" value="Show Modal" />

<modal-window #myModal [allowClose]="true" modalClass="sampleModal">
  <h1 header>Header Text Goes Here</h1>
  <div body>
    <p>Body content goes here</p>
    <input type="button" (click)="myModal.hide()" value="Hide Modal" />
  </div>
  <div footer>Footer content goes here</div>
</modal-window>
```
```css
/*
Use a more specific CSS selector to override the 
basic grey border with a black border
*/
div.modalWindow.sampleModal {
    border-color: black;
}
```
* *allowClose* (optional) - Specifies whether the modal can be closed.  When set to true, an X
is shown in the top-right corner, and the modal will close itself if you click on the X
or click outside of the modal.  When set to false, no X is shown and the modal can only
be closed programmatically.  Defaults to true.
* *modalClass* (optional) - Specifies css class(es) to apply to the modal window.  For example, 
if you want to override the border styling, change the background color, or specify a certain 
width, then that css would be applied here.
* *overlayClass* (optional) - Specifies css class(es) to apply to the modal window.  For example,
if you want the background overlay to use a different color or opacity, then that css would 
be applied here.

## Styling
Out of the box, the modal intentionally contains a minimal amount of styling: just enough to make the
component presentable for demos.  It's fairly simple to apply your own styles using the modalClass and
overlayClass input parameters.

If you want to override the basic existing styles, such as the border
or padding on the modal window, then use a more specific selector in your stylesheet, as shown in 
the usage example.  For the purpose of overriding the basic styles, it's helpful to
keep in mind that the modal window will always be a div with the 'modalWindow' class in addition
to any user-specified classes

## Demo

In order to demo the functonality:
1. Instal node.js / npm if you haven't already
2. Clone the repo and navigate to its root folder
3. Run the following:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm run playground
```
